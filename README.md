# Airport_flight_SQL_Project

## ✈️ Project Overview
This project analyzes **airport operations data** using **SQL** for data extraction and transformation, and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The goal is to identify key operational insights such as passenger trends, seat utilization, route performance, and seasonal demand patterns to support **data-driven decision-making for airlines**.

---
## Objectives
- Analyze **passenger and flight trends** across airports and routes.  
- Identify **top-performing and underperforming routes** based on passenger volume and seat utilization.  
- Detect **seasonal patterns** and **year-over-year growth trends** in air traffic.  
- Provide **actionable insights** to improve airline route planning, capacity utilization, and profitability.

# Problem Statements Solved 
| 1 | Total passengers per origin–destination pair | Identify the most frequented routes |
| 2 | Average seat utilization per flight | Detect high and low occupancy flights |
| 3 | Top 5 most traveled airport routes | Find busiest travel corridors |
| 4 | Total flights & passengers per city | Discover key airport hubs |
| 5 | Total distance flown per airport | Understand operational reach |
| 6 | Monthly & yearly flight trends | Analyze seasonality and performance |
| 7 | Routes with passenger/seat ratio < 0.5 | Identify underutilized routes |
| 8 | Top 3 most active origin airports | Reveal airports with max flight operations |
| 9 | Top city sending flights to Bend, OR | Discover major contributors |
| 10 | Longest flight route by distance | Assess long-haul route performance |

Additional advanced queries (11–20) analyze **seasonal growth**, **route consistency**, **weighted utilization**, and **annual performance trends**.
## Tools & Technologies
**SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation  
- **Power BI:** Dashboard visualization and storytelling  
- **Excel / CSV:** Data preprocessing  
- **DAX:** Measures for KPIs (seat utilization, YoY growth, etc.)

## Power BI Dashboard Insights
The interactive dashboard provides:
- **Top Routes & Cities** – identifies busiest and most profitable connections  
- **Passenger Trends** – reveals seasonality and long-term growth  
- **Seat Utilization** – detects inefficiencies and overcapacity routes  
- **Monthly Flight Trends** – shows traffic peaks and operational gaps  
- **Geographical Map** – visualizes origin-destination patterns
  
## Key Findings
- Several routes showed **declining passenger traffic**, indicating the need for route optimization.  
- **Underutilized flights (<50% seat occupancy)** revealed potential cost inefficiencies.  
- Identified **peak travel months** for major cities to optimize seasonal scheduling.  
- Highlighted **long-haul routes** with strong performance for targeted expansion.

---

## Strategic Recommendations
- Optimize **flight frequency and capacity** based on demand trends.  
- Focus on **high-growth routes** for expansion.  
- Introduce **dynamic pricing** to improve off-peak utilization.  
- Align **marketing and operations** with seasonal passenger surges.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **data-driven insights** can enhance **airline operational efficiency** and **profitability**.  
By integrating SQL-based data analysis with Power BI storytelling, airlines can make smarter, evidence-based decisions for **network optimization and capacity management**.## Conclusion

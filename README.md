# Airport_flight_SQL_Project

## ✈️ Project Overview
This project analyzes **airport operations data** using **SQL** for data extraction and transformation, and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The goal is to identify key operational insights such as passenger trends, seat utilization, route performance, and seasonal demand patterns to support **data-driven decision-making for airlines**.

---
## Objectives
- Analyze **passenger and flight trends** across airports and routes.  
- Identify **top-performing and underperforming routes** based on passenger volume and seat utilization.  
- Detect **seasonal patterns** and **year-over-year growth trends** in air traffic.  
- Provide **actionable insights** to improve airline route planning, capacity utilization, and profitability.
